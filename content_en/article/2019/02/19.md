The paper is devoted to knowledge representation technologies, reasoning models and methods of generating cognitive hypotheses in artificial intelligence systems. Practical emphasis is placed on the use of problem-oriented knowledge graphs as an educational technology in the training of specialists in the field of nuclear physics and nuclear energy. The proposed information solutions and approaches cover the tasks of computer detection and classification of nuclear knowledge and competences on the basis of ontologies, semantic annotation tools for full-text network content and representation of information objects in graph databases equipped with logical inference tools. The applied part of the project are presented publicly available semantic web portal which includes prototypes for the following graphs of nuclear knowledge: the world centre of nuclear data; events and publications CERN; databases and network services of the IAEA; educational materials of the MSU and MEPhI in nuclear physics; nuclear research centers of the Russian Federation,;journals for nuclear physics; the joint graph of nuclear knowledge. Interactive visual navigation through knowledge graphs is performed using special search widgets and an intelligent RDF browser. The RDF browser allows users to make visual tours of knowledge graphs in any direction and at any distance, extracting the necessary information in the form of metadata, hypertext links, full-text and media content associated with a particular node of the graph. Operations with semantic repositories are performed on cloud platforms using PaaS and DBaaS service models, which provides scalability of the involved data stores and network services. The results of performance testing of the semantic base of nuclear knowledge and metric of the computational processes are presented. The innovative potential of the proposed solutions in relation to educational activities is considered.
