The data on the change in the personnel exposure at different stages of the nuclear power plant life cycle are presented. The evolution of the measures on reduction in the exposure and their efficiency are considered. The role of the remote and automated devices in the reduction of the personnel exposure during maintenance and inspection is shown. The main fields of the studies on solving the tasks of the personnel exposure optimization during the NPP decommissioning are presented.
