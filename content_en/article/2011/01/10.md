The results of the development of the algorithm and M36 code which is used to define a direction to the failed fuel sub-assembly in the core, a sector and a group of the slots in the sector where the failed fuel sub-assembly is located are presented. The results of the calculation using the M36 code are compared with the test data and the generally good agreement for the reactor core slots is shown.
