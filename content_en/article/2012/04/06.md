The present paper concentrates on the problem of errors committed by NPP MCR operators during implementation of operating procedures. It is proposed to categorize such errors into four classes as follows: selection of inappropriate procedure, incorrect execution of procedure, navigation errors, and communication errors. These categories of errors have been described and analyzed in detail in the paper. Each type of errors is illustrated by the real examples. The causes of the errors have been also investigated. It was revealed that a weaknesses of procedures is the main contributor to the committed errors. The following two aspects of two-column symptom-oriented procedures that impact on the operator activity were revealed: complicated logic which underlie the transition from the left column of procedure to the right one; and absence of tools for visual emphasis of procedure elements.
