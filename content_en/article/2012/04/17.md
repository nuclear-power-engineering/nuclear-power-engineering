In the paper, the new approach using the anthropomorphic voxel phantom for dose reconstruction at radiation accidents is proposed. This approach permits to differentiate correctly the tissue or organ doses for victims of accidents, and allows not only specifying the epicrisis, but has also obvious prognostic value. As an example, three severe radiation accidents of the recent past are chosen. Calculated data for these accidents are, as a whole, in good agreement with these ones received by the world community. In cases of doses discrepancy with reference data, the possible reasons of divergences are offered.
