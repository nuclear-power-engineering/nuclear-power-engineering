The results of problem-oriented research on innovative low-temperature chemical thermodecom-positional surface modification technology for new radiation photonics materials (radiation fluorescent nanolayer oxide coatings) development are shown. Basic nanoscale multicomponent oxide coatings structural types are determined and carefully studied using an atomic force microscope. The formation of globular structures in the two-layer coating with copper oxide surface layer is revealed. The main principles of oxide coatings structure formation are given. The ability of chemical-structural modification technology for modified objects surface micro and nano-relief smoothening is found. The elastic moduli of nanoscale oxide coatings are obtained using the two-layer body model.
