Experimental researches of crystallization processes under hardening of clamp material received by mixing liquid alumophosphate binding with magnesium oxide powder are conducted. It is shown that a primary stage of structurization of a clamp material is the structure of amorphous particles of magnesium hydroxide. The crystal structure of hard material is formed in an amorphous phase. The process of crystal phases accumulation is shown.

The investigated clamp materia is a porous material. The amorphous porous structure is penetrated by the crystal structure, including both separate crystals, and congestions of spatial crystal structures.
