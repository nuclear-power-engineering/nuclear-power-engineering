The preferences of 19F(n,α)16N nuclear reaction use for radiation control channels test on water-cooled power reactors are analyzed. The new measurements for more accurate determination of 19F(n,α)16N reaction cross section energy dependence have been carried out. A set of new methods for background reducing and improvement of events determination reliability was developed.
