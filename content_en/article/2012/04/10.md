Results of experimental and settlement-theoretical studies of the processes accompanying an intercontour leak of a steam generator for power installations on lead or lead-bismuth coolants are presented.
The results of research the processes of appearing a micro-, operational and acceptable, and  a  large  leak  of  the  working  body  in  the  reactor  loop  and  recommendations  of  the  actions  of operational personnel in similar accidents are given. 
A review of experimental studies carried out at NNSTU on the structure and characteristics of two-component flows at different flow the working body in the flow of lead and lead-bismuth coolant at a temperature of 600C, flow rates from 0.1 to 5.0 m/s, the content «light» phase 1–3% to 50% by volume is presented.
