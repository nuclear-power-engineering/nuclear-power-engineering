New method to calculate equiprobability bins from Legendre expansion scattering cross-sections is proposed. The method uses a correction of equiprobability bins boundaries to provide a conservation of the first angular moment. The code CRSRD-ST to reformat cross sections from DTF to ACE format with proposed technique is developed. Numerical results shows the method proposed significantly improves an agreement between deterministic and Monte-Carlo calculations.
