To predict equipment lifetime under flow-accelerated corrosion there is used Chexal-Horowitz empirical model, realized as ECW-02. One of the most important parameters is Keller coefficient of pipe geometry. To adapt Chexal model to Russian NPP units there is developed procedure of Keller coefficient estimation by using of control data and ECW-02 prediction. As result, stochastic characteristics of Keller coefficients are obtained. To estimate the error connected with admixture content in metal on erosion-corrosion wear rate there is performed comparison of wear rate calculated by using of Durex equation and the one predicted by ECW-02.
