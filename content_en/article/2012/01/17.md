In this paper, was considered a method of determining the mass of plutonium and getter (additive in the form of uranium metal) in a fragment of a fuel pin reactor BN-800 10 mm by mathematical modeling, the method based on measuring the intrinsic emission of granulated MOX fuel. There were researched the influence of the presence of a getter, the vibrations of the inner radius and thickness of the cladding, the determination of the mass of plutonium.
