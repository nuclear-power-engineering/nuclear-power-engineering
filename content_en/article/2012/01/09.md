Cleaning of gas-air flows in different branches of industry remains one of the most important directions in the field of technologies of environmental protection from aerosols of the different origin, including radioactive and toxic ones.

High-efficient aerosol filters being used today at NPP are the source of large volumes of radioactive waste subject to burial. They have a limited lifetime, and their fabrication and operation are costly. The situation arisen with gas cleaning from radioactive and toxic aerosol particles at NPP requires, on the one hand, updating of traditional approaches and, on the other hand, development of fundamentally new methods and aids of air cleaning, namely, the principle of combined cleaning based on the fact that particles take up specific properties in ionized gas and then are to be caught on filters.

The problems of experimental investigation of the effect of intensive aeronization on catching of aerosol particles from the air flow using combined filtering systems is the subject of this paper.
