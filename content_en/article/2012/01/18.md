It have been done calculation of swelling austenitic stainless steel ЧС-68 and diameter profiles of fuel pins cladding from this steel, passed operation in an active zone of reactor BN-600, having reached the values of a damaging dose exceeding the regular in work. Comparison of calculations with the experimental data [1] received on irradiated fuel pins, has shown that at carrying out of calculations of a residual resource it is necessary to consider the ovality factor.
