The mathematical model of processes of prompt-critical disassembly excursion of an LMFBR is developed. The model is realized in two-dimensional program ANPEX which allows to calculate accident development at occurrence of secondary criticality in the fused core. The description of results of testing of the program and results of calculation of stage of instant criticality by means of code ANPEX for BN-600 is given.
