In the paper are presented the calculation results of transient cooling of reactor facility (RF) in the natural circulation mode under anticipated accident with coolant leak that is postulated by safety analysis report (SAR). The postulated initial even of accident is leak appearance from reactor tank that bring to fast level decreasing into tank. It was shown that used at modernization of RF design steps (setting the hydraulic lock at down-flow pipeline from RF directly into tank in combination with upper positioning of coolant inlet to core) significantly increase the degree of reactor facility safety at considered maximal design accident. Calculations were performed based on TRAC code. International thermal hydraulic network code TRAC was designed for the safety analysis of water-cooled NPP.
