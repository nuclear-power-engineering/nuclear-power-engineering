Provides a theoretical and experimental justification for the effects of ultrasound on the welds during welding equipment of nuclear power plants. As a result of exposure to ultrasound metal structure welding seam is fine-grained and homogeneous, excludes internal voltage in metal, is removal of residual stresses in in parajoint zone. This leads to a significant increase in strength characteristics and resource equipment of nuclear power stations. Impact of ultrasound technology are in the process of welding and surfacing.
