Linear stochastic filter algorithm is developed for steam generator heat-exchanged tubes assembly. Due to large dimension of mathematical model there are some criteria are formulated and Excel is choose as media for filter algorithm realization. The model researching is performed: analysis of model to different parameters, including efficiency of preventive measures performed.
