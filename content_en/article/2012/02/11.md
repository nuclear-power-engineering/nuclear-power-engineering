Open and experimentally justified a new physical phenomenon – a property of the flow of coolant lead – the process of implementing a purely gaseous cavitation process and the impossibility of ‘traditional’ vapor cavitation. Proposed and experimentally substantiated by three independent methods of model cavitation in the flow of gas coolant lead to the conditions of the reactor circuit. It is proved that the traditional steam (steam and gas), cavitation in the flow of coolant can not lead. The experimentally determined conditions for the appearance and characteristics of gas cavitation. Experimentally proved the absence of cavitation erosion wear of the impeller pump made of steel with an oxidecoated in lead coolant temperature 470–500°C, flow rate of lead approx. 10 m/s, the pump speed to 1200 rpm. When operating in a developed cavitation gas approx. 50 hours including 17 hours in provoking dynamic tests with the cyclical development of cavitation breakdown of filing, followed by the resumption of feeding, and development of cavitation cycle with a period of 3–5 seconds (a total of more than 15000 cycles).
