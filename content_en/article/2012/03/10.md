This paper includes statistical analysis of isotopic composition results that were got with program MGAU. Multivariate analysis was chosen as suitable statistical method. In accordance with results of analysis the recommendations were made for using of this program code in combination with Low Energy Germanium Detector. These recommendations give opportunity to optimize of measurement process of uranium isotopic composition.
