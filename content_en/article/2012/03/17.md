The results of calculation analysis of experiments on thermal hydraulic of the seven fuel pin assembly under supercritical coolant parameters are presented. Calculations were done in accordance with experimental condition and results of SSC RF IPPE on modeling coolant freon-12. Comparison between experimental and calculation results was carried out. Possible ways of improvement of calculation technique were discussed.
