There are results of application of undetermined Lagrangian coefficients method in the analysis of consistency of experiments from ICSBEP Handbook in the current paper. It has been obtained biases to initial conditions of experiments (dimensions and concentrations) and to cross-sections based on the fact that criticality conditions in the real experiments have been strictly reached. Taking into account of these biases allows removing observed contradictions between calculation and experiment data which was not possible to remove using traditional Generalized list square method. Calculations have been made for experiments performed in SSC RF IPPE.
