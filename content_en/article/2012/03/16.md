The paper presents the results of calculations of the experiments conducted at the GE2M-PG test facility in SSC RF-IPPE. These experiments simulate the operation of steam generator during the cooling of the core of the “NPP-2006” VVER reactor by the joint action of passive safety systems HA-2 and PHRS in case of accidents with loss of primary coolant. The purpose of the work was to conduct a post test calculations and verification of computer codes TECH-M and KORSAR/GP in terms of modeling of heat transfer processes in a steam generator model at low heat fluxes in the presence of noncondensable gases, and without them. As a result of verification it is possible to conclude about the ability of computer codes to reproduce the phenomenon of non-condensable gases distribution, accumulation and their effects on heat transfer in a steam generator tube bundle.
