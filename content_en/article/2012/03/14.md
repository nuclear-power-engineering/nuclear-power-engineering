The paper describes the development , laboratory tests, and accelerator experiments of a measurement procedure of power-release in lead and uraniun samples. The measurement procedure involved provides a reliable measurement of temterature of the sample at its rate of the change of 0,1 K per minute. The power-release data received in the lead and uranium sample are very important for tackling the problems of optimization of heat-removal from the irradiated target sample. The results obtained contributes to the development of ADS.
