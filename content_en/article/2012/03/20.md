The Results of alloy E110 tests in the strain rate range 2,4·10-4 s-1 to 1·103 s-1 at room temperature are presented. The experimental data were received by means magnetic -pulsed and standart quasistatistical methods of loading in interval of rate deformation 2,4⋅10-4 с-1–1⋅103 с-1. The dependence flow stress from the true deformation (to ~1,2) ring, tubular and segmental specimens made from fuel tube ∅9,1⋅7, 73 mm, as well as cylindrical samples are determined. Ring, tubular and segmental specimens have the same texture, but their deformation is carried out in different directions. Cylindrical samples have an another texture. Such tests give possibility to estimate the Influence of texture deformation and direction deformation on the deformation hardening of alloy. The Generalized equation of flow stress from the true deformation was offered with take into account the particular experimental results and the earlier elaborate Universal Model of Zr-Alloys plastic straining. On the base of the statistical analysis of experimental data and this Equation it was be shown that deformation hardening alloy is isotropically, i.e. does not depend on the texture of deformation alloy.
