Mean neutron energies, one-group cross sections of neutron capture by uranium-238 and fission of americium-241 for the Russian reactors BN-600, BREST-300 and RBEC-340 (RBEC-M) are calculated using MCNP5 code. For RBEC-340 these characteristics are calculated for the reactor with its standard lead-bismuth coolant as well as for this reactor cooled with Pb-208, as it was proposed by the authors of the paper.
