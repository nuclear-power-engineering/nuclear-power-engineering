The comparison of the two different approaches for simulation of the force interaction of the two-phase flow with the external surfaces is presented in the paper. The two-velocity two-phase flow model was developed for calculation of the two-phase pressure drop for the cross flow across tube bundle. The pressure drops across tube bundle were calculated with this model using two different approaches for simulation of the two-phase flow drag with the tube bundle. The calculated results were compared with the experimental ones. The best approach for simulation of the two-phase flow drag with the tube bundle based on the empirical two-phase flow hydraulic resistance correlations was identified.
