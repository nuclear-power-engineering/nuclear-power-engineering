In JSC «NIIAR» operated research single-circuit reactor setup made the VK-50 boiling like. Feature of the setup made the VC-50 is that the reactor vessel consists of a two-component metal (the metal core thickness of 100 mm and a cladding corrosion thickness of 20 mm). During the ultrasound control the body was found several problems: control of deposition and to identify areas of fusion, control of the base metal, bred for the welding. In the developed technique provides a solution to these problems, which has found practical application
