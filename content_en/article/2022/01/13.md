At the current stage, the main task facing the world’s leading states is to preserve and increase technological leadership. The Russian economy also faces this challenge. The main question is how to create an ecosystem for the development of territories that promotes the emergence and implementation of innovations. The experience of creating «silicon» valleys in the United States, China, India, and Russia shows that it is necessary to combine four main elements in one territory: education, science, business, and a comfortable living environment. But the most important thing is- that there are effective mechanisms for interaction between these elements. One of these mechanisms may be 216 Federal law «On innovative scientific and technological centers» (ISTC). The law provides for a significant number of preferences: zero income tax and VAT, reduced unified social tax, etc. In Obninsk, the first science city in Russia, created An Innovative scientific and technological center “Park of nuclear and medical technologies”. Its main areas of ISTC will be nuclear, medical, pharmaceutical and information technologies. The article presents the main issues of the operation of an Innovative scientific and technological center, personnel training, a comprehensive plan for the development of the territory, priority high – tech projects.
