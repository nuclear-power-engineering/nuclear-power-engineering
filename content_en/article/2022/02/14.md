The article delineates the nuclear energy system modelling application package (NESAPP) which can be used to develop models for assessing material flows, needs for nuclear fuel cycle services and economic performance metrics for evolving nuclear energy systems. NESAPP is a set of codes designed to support nuclear energy planning and nuclear fuel cycle transition scenario studies, including the following modules: NUDAPS (a module for calculating thermal neutron cross-sections, resonance integrals and few-group neutron cross-sections, and associated uncertainties), NUCLEX (a module for calculating the evolution of the nuclide composition and characteristics of nuclear fuel in reactors and in the external nuclear fuel cycle), NUCAB (a module for adjusting isotopic composition and blending), FANES (a module for analysing material flows and integrating data in nuclear energy system evolution scenarios), ECNES (a module for assessing economic performance metrics for nuclear energy system evolution scenarios). Each module can be considered both as an independent software tool and as a component of the software tool for technical and economic modelling of the nuclear energy system deployment. Various calculation models are implemented in the modules, allowing users to assess the uncertainties associated with the method applied as well as to perform uncertainty treatment with respect to modelling results due to the initial data uncertainty. The paper also provides some examples of applying the developed tools.
