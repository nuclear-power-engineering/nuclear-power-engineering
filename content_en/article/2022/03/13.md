Purpose. The paper considers the influence of the spatial grid type on the result of solving the equation of neutron transport in the nuclear power plant (NPP) shielding.

Method. Neutron fields have been calculated in a realistic model of a liquid metal cooled fast neutron tank reactor with an integral equipment layout. Structured cubic and unstructured hexahedral grids (PMSNSYS and FRIGATE codes) and unstructured tetrahedral and prismatic grids (RADUGA T code) are used. Limiting values of the group fluxes averaged over the material zones for refined grids have been obtained.

Results. It has been shown that the calculation results depend on the type of approximation of the curvilinear inner boundaries between the material zones rather than on the grid cell type (cube, hexahedron, tetrahedron, prism). Using «toothed» approximations for curvilinear boundaries leads to an increase in the area of the boundaries, as well as to the neutron flux refraction condition arising on them. These effects lead to an overestimation of the transport equation solution, and also in all energy groups.

Conclusion. When solving an equation of neutron transport in the NPP shielding by a grid method, it is necessary to use grids other than leading to «toothed» approximations of the inner boundaries. Tetrahedral or prismatic grids, or grids of arbitrary hexahedrons can be recommended, as well as composite grids in which cubic cells are located inside the material zone, and hexahedron cells are located near the zone boundary.
