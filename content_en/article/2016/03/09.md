The article presents results of pin drop test numerical simulation to containers for spent fuel transportation TUK-128. 
This situation applies to design basis accident during transportation of spent nuclear fuel by road outside a hazardous manufacture (outside nuclear power plant site or processing plant).

Deformation calculation and numerical simulation at failing container for transportation of SNF on the pin from height of 1 meter runs in elastoplasticfield of work construction materials. 
It is important that there are many of options for setting construction materials plastic properties. 
In this the simulation results depend significantly on the choice of way to giving plastic properties.

The most common approach taking into account plasticity is the set tabulated function gives relationship between stresses and plastic deformations. 
This plasticity description does not account for not only temperature dependence plasticity but also kinematic hardening (the dependence elastic limit of deformation intensity). 
Using this plasticity model gives significant reduction to computational complexity, that especially important if required dozen of cases computational analysis.

Another, a more adequate approach to define plasticity is to take into account dependence of yield stress not only on the strain and its intensity, but also on the temperature (model plasticity Johnson-Cook). 
In this case, for each type of structural material needed to determine 57 parameters. 
Currently, there is no unequivocal method for determining this parameters, so the article provides method for their calculation. 
The disadvantage of JohnsonCook plasticity model is a significant increase in computational complexity. 
For this reason, the present work provides comparative analysis of calculation results with define
plasticity by JohnsonCook model and tabulated functions.

Modelling is carried out for the two calculation cases: fall at the hull cover (made of stainless steel); falling on the hull bottom (made of ductile cast iron). 
Considered variants to take into account construction materials plastic properties compared with the results of drop tests to containers TUK-128.

Impact modeling performed by finite element method with using LS-DYNA program.
