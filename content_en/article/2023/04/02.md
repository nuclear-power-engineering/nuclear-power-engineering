Studies of maneuverable modes of VVER to confirm the possibility of participation of nuclear power plants in the mode of daily carrying capacity have been conducted for quite a long time. Tests at various nuclear power plants with VVER-1000 (Zaporizhia NPP in 1998, Khmelnitsky NPP in 2005, Tien Wan NPP in 2007) have shown the practical possibility of NPP participation in the daily schedule of carrying capacity, however, the commissioning of nuclear power plants with VVER-1200 requires similar work on all new units with VVER-1200: NVAES-2, LNPP-2 Belarusian NPP. The article presents some aspects of the use of noise control methods for analyzing the condition of equipment and the core.

Since the emergence of the technology of noise analysis of signals from VVER reactor installations, researchers have formulated several criteria for obtaining results of appropriate quality. The fundamental requirement for conducting noise experiments was the registration of data in stationary modes of operation of power units, since any non-stationarity made significant changes in spectral estimates, which ultimately complicated the work and «distorted» the results obtained. This requirement was included in the operating instructions of various diagnostic systems using noise signal analysis methods (the SЬS system, manufactured by Siemens). For a long period of time, the current situation suited both developers of various diagnostic systems and NPP personnel operating them at power units. On the one hand, this was due to the imperfection of the technical means used (low speed of analog-to-digital converters, limited storage capacity, bulky equipment, etc.), on the other hand, the use of domestic NPP power units only in the base load mode without tracking daily power fluctuations in the power system.

The standard archives of the upper block level system, the in-reactor control systemand additionally produced multi-channel «fast» measurements with a frequency of 1 kHz for the analysis of maneuverable mode 95–55–95% of the VVER-1200 reactor plant were analyzed. Global disturbances of the core have been detected after one step of the regulatory body of the control and protection system, which attenuates within one second if the next step of the control and protection system has not occurred during this time. Such fast neutron processes can be controlled only by neutron-noise measurements with an upper frequency of at least 20 Hz.
