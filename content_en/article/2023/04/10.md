Modern civilization has reached a high level of development with power-consuming industry and lots of material goods. At the same time, advances in technology have led to environmental pollution and have probably caused global warming effects. The major contributor to the pollution is power industry, each energy technology inevitably generating waste in the course of its lifecycle that contaminates the environment. However, nuclear power accounts for the smallest possible pollution level compared with all other industries. Issues of abandoning the combustion of hydrocarbons and switching to low-carbon energy, including nuclear, have been under debate within the scientific community. Still, no perception of nuclear power as safe and low-carbon has been yet formed in society. In this connection, the need is shown for changing the attitude of the population towards nuclear power given the fact that there is no loyal attitude to it in many countries. It has been noted that the positive attitude towards nuclear power shaped in educators will be shared by students as future citizens who will sеt the national development trends. Arguments have been proposed to be used in discussions with engineering and humanitarian communities concerning the inevitability of switching to a new energy platform based on fast reactors with a closed fuel cycle, this expected to provide reactors with fuel for hundreds of years to come and minimize the amounts of spent fuel. It has been recommended that positive attitudes should be developed in a broad spectrum of stakeholders, largely among educators and secondary school and university students.
