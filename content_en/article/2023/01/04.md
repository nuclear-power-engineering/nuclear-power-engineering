On the base of the developed integral dynamic model of the fuel storage pool (SP), taking into account the specifics of the Bilibino NPP and the corresponding calculation program, the results of calculations of the temperature dynamics of the coolants and claddings of the fuel elements located in the spent fuel pools 1 – 4 of this facility for the period up to 2035 are presented. Based on the obtained results, the analysis of the dynamics of the corrosion state of the SFA fuel rod claddings and the walls of the storage canisters was carried out.

The Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant consists of 4 Power Units with EGP-6 water-graphite channel reactors. At the moment, Power Unit No 1 has been shut down, Units No 2 – 4 have received a license for operation until December 2025. Currently, spent fuel assemblies (SFA) and CPS channels in storage pools SP-1,2 are stored in hermetic canisters made of carbon steel 20 filled with nitrogen in «dry» conditions, while SFA and CPS in storage pools SP-3, 4 are stored in stainless steel canisters in «wet» conditions. An important point in substantiating the further extension of the operation of the power units of the Bilibino NPP is the analysis and justification of the possibility of long-term accident-free storage of spent nuclear fuel in the fuel storage pool after the final shutdown of all reactors.
