The paper considers the neutronic foundations for large-scale production of 238Pu for independent energy sources. The 238Pu isotope is a unique source of long-term independent energy supply in various devices for remote areas on Earth and in space. At the same time, the capacity for its production currently available in Russia and worldwide is insufficient.

The paper considers the chains for producing the 238Pu isotope and defines the optimal spectrum and neutron flux for its production. A conclusion is made that the most attractive starting isotope is 237Np that can be extracted from irradiated nuclear fuel. The proposed method allows for large-scale production of plutonium, which is distinctive in high content of the 238Pu isotope and low content of the 236Pu isotope.
