The paper presents the estimates for the possibility for large-scale production of <sup>238</sup>Pu in the core of a VVER-1000 power reactor.
The Np-fraction of minor actinides extracted from transuranic radioactive waste is proposed to be used as the starting material.
The irradiation device with NpO 2 fuel elements is installed at the reactor core center.
The NpO 2 fuel lattice pitch is varied and the irradiation device is surrounded by a heavy moderator layer to create the best possible spectral conditions for large-scale production (~ 3 kg/year) of conditioned plutonium with the required isotopic composition (not less than 85% of <sup>238</sup>Pu and not more than 2 ppm of <sup>236</sup>Pu).
Plutonium with such isotopic composition can be used as the thermal source in thermoelectric radioisotope generators and in cardiac pacemakers.
It has been demonstrated that the estimated scale of the <sup>238</sup>Pu production in a VVER-type power reactor exceeds considerably the existing scale of its production in research reactors.
