A technique has been proposed and thermal conductivity problem has been solved analytically for the system of layered cylindrical fuel elements. Based on the results, an algorithm and FORTRAN software for the thermo–hydraulic calculation of a channel (THCC) have been developed to calculate the temperature field and thermal flux density in a fuel assembly with layered cylindrical fuel elements. The software also provides the calculation of the surface boiling onset temperatures on the fuel elements, critical fluxes and corresponding thermotechnical margins. Two coolant circulation schemes are provided for a fuel assembly: straight flow and Field tube. The results of the THCC calculations were compared with the analogous ones. A correlation between the calculation results is shown as well as the advantages of the THCC software performance.
