The results of the level switch based on 24 point acoustic probes which monitored process into the testing integrated unit KV2 threeyear operation was generalized. It has been estimated that the developed level switch worked satisfactorily. They make possible monitoring the thermohydraulic processes associated with vapor phase formation died to the increase of liquid level and steam condensation into reactor.
