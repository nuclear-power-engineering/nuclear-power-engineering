Technical implementation of solid–phase method for adjustment of oxygen content in lead alloys coolants, developed by IPPE, is realized by means of specially designed devices – mass exchangers which are a significant component of heavy liquid–metal coolant technology. On the design stage of mass exchanger it is necessary to calculate major features of mass exchanger. At this paper the calculation method of mass exchangers with solid–phase oxygen source (lead oxide) is described which allows to estimate the major features of apparatus and to predict it changes in depend on operating time.
