For modelling of the local irradiation and hyperthermia synergetic at the radionuclide vertebroplasty, the study of the temperature fields caused by bone cement polymerization is carried out. Two groups of experiments involving the nonstationary temperatures distribution measurements were done, namely, the cement polymerization a) in the isolated cuvette, and b) in a vertebra. For experiments numerical modeling, the 3D non–stationary KANAL code applied in thermohydraulics of nuclear power installations is adapted. The consistency of measured data and simulated ones is obtained for temperature distributions, the spatial and time–dependent as well. The most important is the closeness in experimental and simulating temperature maximum value at cement polymerization in a vertebra. The executed study grants the theoretical support of vertebroplasty in two aspects: a) by providing with the developed calculation techniques, and b) by estimating the curative effect because of the bone tissue heating.
