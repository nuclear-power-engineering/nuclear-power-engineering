An opportunity to use the acoustic emission method to control microdefects in the equipment is considered. In particular, for the first time it is shown experimentally that while sodium is interacting with water, the acoustic emission parameters are determined by the size of the interacting area for reacting components of the reaction. It is assumed that the major source of acoustic emission in the reaction of sodium interacting with water is generation of acoustic vibrations caused by phase transitions of sodium hydroxide. The obtained data make it possible to design a highefficient system to control through defects in claddings of slugs with sodium.
