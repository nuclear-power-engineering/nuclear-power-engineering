Electrochemical studies conducted on samples of pipe heaters steam generators made of steel 08Х18Н10Т not of used after washing with acid solutions and complexing with various additives followed by passivation or without passivation. Found that the best passivation marked processing samples in solutions containing aluminum nitrate – a stationary potential, while in comparison with the investigation of shifts to a more positive region, which indicates the high shielding of active sites on the surface of the metal.
