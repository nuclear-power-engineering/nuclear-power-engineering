The calculation studies on VVER-1000 fuel composition when multiple plutonium and uranium recycling along with medium enriched uranium feeding (REMIX-fuel) were made. The calculation results of natural uranium consumption, separation work, minor actinide accumulation, and the dose rates of FAs with fresh fuel are given. A comparison between VVER1000 types reactors fuelled with different fuels (UO2, REMIX, MOX) on characteristics indicated above was performed.
