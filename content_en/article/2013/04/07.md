The specificity of rupture pin defect and gas flow pin defect are examined. It is complicated to identify the first type of defects about its feature: initial or secondary. It is hard to localize the other flow defect. Depth analysis is demanded of the complex investigation including the defect modeling results. Article data illustrates the urgent need of waterless technology is one must during preparation of faulty pins for post reactor investigations.
