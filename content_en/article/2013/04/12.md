Experimental data on the flowrate distribution in working channels dummies of «Research reactor model» experimental facility with doubleloop configuration are provided. The procedures of experiments performance and received experimental data processing are provided in detail. Based on the fulfilled experiments, the conclusion was made on applicability of the obtained data for the reactor plant safety analysis.
