The results of numerical simulation of the coolant flow in the model of a fast breeder reactor are presented. 3Dmodel of an experimental facility is developed and the simulation is carried out with ANSYS CFD code. The porous body approach is used for simulation of complicated elements of the reactor model such as heat exchangers, reactor core. The numerical results of thermohydraulic characteristics for the case of the coolant forced circulation as well as for the case of emergency cooling are presented. The numerical results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. The performance capability of a passive emergency cooling system with selfcontained heat exchangers is confirmed.
