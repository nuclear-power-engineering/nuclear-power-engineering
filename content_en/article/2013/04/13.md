Due to the rapid development of space exploration programs using rockets with nuclear facilities there was a necessity to quickly and efficiently calculate temperature fields of head part of missile to ensure safe transport of nuclear installations to orbit. We consider the formulation and solving algorithms of the nonstationary problem for calculation of temperature fields of shell of revolution in hightemperature aerodynamic flow with known temperature. We propose and consider the physical model and calculation of temperature fields in the frontal part and in circle sections of the shell of revolution. The proposed physical model of shell heat transfer with the ablation of material will predict the ability to perform the targeting of the shell by calculating the temperature fields and the total thickness of entrained layers for different possible values of the parameters defining the ablation parameters for shell material.
