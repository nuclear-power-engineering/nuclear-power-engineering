The results of research proving possibility of using a system of accumulation of thermal energy in the nuclear power plant with the VVER reactor for ensuring variable power of a turbogenerator with the participation of the nuclear power plant in regulation of frequency of current in a power network are given in this article. Research is conducted in relation to one of possible versions of the project of the power unit of the nuclear power plant with the VVER reactor of the rated power of 1200 MW and system of accumulation of thermal energy with insignificant deviations in the thermal scheme, power and a design of system of rather published data of the project.
