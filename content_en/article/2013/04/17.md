The paper presents the results of the calculations in support of MIR reactor conversion to lowenriched uranium fuel (LEU fuel). There were two LEU fuel types with 19.7% enrichment studied based on uranium dioxide and U9%Mo alloy. The neutronphysical and thermal hydraulic calculations show that there is a slight decrease (46%) of fast neutron fluence on the experimental fuel element claddings during the conversion as well as a significant decrease of the annual consumption of FAs (3033%) and 235U (812%). However, the total uranium consumption increases by approximately 4 times. The results also show that the conversion to LEU fuel does not degrade the safe operation criteria (performance of the control and safety rods, departure from nuclear boiling, heat exchange crisis, etc.). It is concluded that the conversion of the MIR research reactor to LEUfuel is feasible in principle with insignificant changes of the reactor experimental capabilities.
