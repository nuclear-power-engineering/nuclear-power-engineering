The article deals with the problem of pollution circulation circuits with heavy liquid metal coolant slag deposits on the basis of lead oxide. As a solution to the above problem, the method of purification of hydrogen, comprising administering a mixture of Ar-H2O-H2 directly into the flow of the circulating heavy liquid metal coolant. As the device is used for hydrogen purification proposed mechanical (disk design) gas dispergator. A program of its method of testing conducted hydrogen purification circulation loop stand TT2M with gas dispergator. Based on these results the gas dispergator can be recommended not only for research stands, but also for the first contours of promising reactors with heavy liquid metal coolant.
