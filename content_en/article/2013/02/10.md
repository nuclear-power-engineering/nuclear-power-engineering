Algorithms of 3D neutron physics simulating for fast transient abnormal conditions in BNtype reactors core were developed in the GVA code. A quasistatic approximation is used for the solution of nonstationary equation of reactor physics This approach divides the original equation onto the system of two equations: for calculating of the amplitude factor, which is quickly changed during the time and does not depend on spatial coordinates, and formfunction, which depends on spatial coordinates and is slightly changed during the time. The results of test simulating in flow rate stop conditions and in selfmovement of control rods conditions are demonstrated.
