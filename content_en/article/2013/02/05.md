The paper presents the results of research on hydrogen generation in heterogeneous compositions containing aluminum, liquid sodium glass, crystalline sodium metasilicate and water of varying salinity. Found that silicon reagents remove the passivation oxide coating on the surface of aluminum and its translation into an activated state, effectively decompose water into hydrogen. Chemical decomposition into hydrogen efficiently are aqueous solutions with varying degrees of mineralization. The process of generating hydrogen is carried out at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure at high speed and theoretically limiting the release of hydrogen H20.12 kg / 1 kg of Al. The study of chemical processes of decomposition and removal of surface oxide films and the generation of hydrogen from restoration water by reactor metallic materials is one of the tasks of hydrogen safety for nuclear power plants.
