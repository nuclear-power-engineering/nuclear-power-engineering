The paper discusses possible applications of locking media: oil, or high purity water in a rotating shaft seal system main circulation pumps (MCP) of the main circuit with fast reactors cooled by lead and leadbismuth coolant. The analysis was performed based on the need to optimize the operating parameters of the seal and bearing in mind the possible impact of the medium on the locking performance characteristics of the reactor circuit, as in normal operation and in case of emergency admission of significant amounts of oil or condensate water from the rotating shaft seal system MCP to the reactor circuit.
