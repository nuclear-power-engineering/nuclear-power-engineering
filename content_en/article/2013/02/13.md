Irradiation conditions were simulated to test pilot modified fuel rods of the SM reactor under middle (10MW/m2) and maximal (up to 15MW/m2) thermal load. Some postirradiation results are presented. A conclusion was made about the performance of the pilot SM fuel rods with the U content increased by 20%. A comparative analysis of both test conditions and material tests of the SM fuel rods was performed. The material tests results were used as a basis to propose and justify a phenomenological model of fuel rods swelling.
