Presented a hybrid technique for shielding calculation that uses continuous energy Monte Carlo with the weight windows generated with the method of characteristics. Technique proposed implements CADIS (Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling) scheme and includes solving the adjoint multigroup problem with characteristics code MCCG3D to generate the spaceenergy weight windows for the MonteCarlo calculation. A general structure of the technique for use in design calculation is described. Presented numerical results confirm the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed hybrid technique. The advantages of using the method of characteristics in the CADIS scheme are discussed.
