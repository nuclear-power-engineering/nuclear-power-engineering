Present paper is a prolongation of the paper [1] devoted to the theoretical estimations of the direct conversion of thermal energy from the nuclear reactor into the energy of directional flow of infrared radiation. Experimental facilities constructed for the modeling of processes taking place in the systems concerned are described, and a certain part of results obtained is presented. It is shown that efficiency of the direct conversion of the nuclear reactor thermal energy into the energy of directional flow light radiation can be high enough (80–90%).
