Different methods are presented for excess reactivity reduction in the initial fuel loading phase as well as associated transients before the stable state of regular partial reloadings. Different techniques for compensating excess reactivity are being analysed. Two ways of compensating excess reactivity have been shown possible, which do not violate design constraints on FE specific power: with combined (boron carbide + steel) and uranium regular reactivity compensators.
