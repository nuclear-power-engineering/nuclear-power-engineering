We study the mathematical model of Global nuclear energy development until the end of this century. For comparative scenarios analysis of transition to sustainable nuclear energy systems, we use models of heterogeneous world with an allowance for specific national development.

Selected models are closely to real picture of the World of the future, according to international experts. Global Model Scenarios by end of 2100 yr are interdependent and formulated in such a way that the total capacity of Nuclear Energy development in all scenarios was constant and equal. There are two options in this scenarios: 5000 GW for high and 2,500 GW for moderate by the end of 2100 yr.
