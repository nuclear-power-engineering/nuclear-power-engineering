First planetary atom model was finding by Boris N. Chicherin (1828–1904) in Russia. In 1888–1889 Chicherin described this model in scientific review «Zhurnal Russkogo Fiziko Himicheskogo Obshchestva». At 25 years after Niels Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete, and that they revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus, but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another.
