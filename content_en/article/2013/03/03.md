The paper describes the designed fuel element monitoring system for MBIR fast research reactor. The method for localization of failed fuel assemblies on the power operating reactor is proposed. As a result, the time of failed fuel assemblies search on shutdown reactor can be reduced. The method is based on monitoring of delayed neutrons emitted by fission products in coolant, and modeling of the loop distribution of liquid metal coolant.
