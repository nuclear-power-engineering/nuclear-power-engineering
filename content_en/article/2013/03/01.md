Problems of modern nuclear power engineering are brought up and described are the possible solutions on the basis of closed nuclear fuel cycle with fast reactors that meet the requirements of inherent safety for large scale nuclear power industry. This article analyses the content of acting since 2010 Federal State Program “Nuclear power technologies of new generation for the period of 2010–2015 and in perspective until 2020” and its progress. The conclusion is that main principles of “Nuclear power engineering development strategy in Russia in the first half of XXI century”, approved by the government of RF in 2000, remain the same even though they require development concerning new reality at the market of organic fuels, state of Russian and world economies and higher safety requirements (Fukushima) as well as nuclear nonproliferation.
